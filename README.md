# Chessalyze
This project is a web application that aims to replicate Chess.com's Game Review feature, which is only free to players once a day.
Here, users can provide any username from Chess.com, pull their games, and analyze the games using Stockfish's REST API. 
These games can be stored if users decide to create an account.
